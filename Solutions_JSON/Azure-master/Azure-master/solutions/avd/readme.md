# Azure Virtual Desktop solution

This solution will deploy Azure Virtual Desktop in an Azure subscription.  Depending on the options selected, either a personal or pooled host pool can be deployed with this solution.  The pooled option will deploy an App Group with a role assignment and everything to enable FSLogix.

This solution contains many features that are usually enabled manually after deploying a AVD host pool.  Those features are:

- FSLogix:
  - Configures the recommended registry settings on the session hosts.
  - Deploys an Azure File Share, domain joins the Storage Account, and sets the Share and NTFS permissions.
- Scaling Automation:
  - Enables the solution if the host pool is "pooled".  A system assigned identity is deployed with the Automation Account and is assigned the Contributor role on the resource group containing the session hosts.  This limits the privileges the Automation Account has in your subscription.
- Start VM On Connect:
  - Configures the feature for the AVD host pool.
- VDI Optimization Script:
  - The script will remove unnecessary apps, services, and processes from your Windows 10 OS, improving performance and resource utilization.
- AVD Monitoring Solution:
  - Deploys the Log Analytics Workspace with the required Windows Events and Performance Counters.
  - Deploys the Microsoft Monitoring Agent on session hosts.
  - Deploys diagnostic settings on the AVD host pool and workspace.
- Graphics Drivers:
  - Deploys the required extension containing the graphics driver when the appropriate VM size is selected.

## Assumptions

To successfully deploy this solution, you will need to ensure your scenario matches the assumptions below:

- AVD supported marketplace image.
- Acquired the appropriate licensing for the operating system.
- Landing zone deployed in Azure:
  - Virtual network and subnet(s)
  - ADDS synchronized with Azure AD

## Prerequisites

To successfully deploy this solution, you will need to first ensure the following prerequisites have been completed:

- Create a Security Group in ADDS for your AVD users.  Once the object has synchronized to Azure AD, make note of the name and object ID in Azure AD.  This will be needed to deploy the solution.

## Considerations

If you are deploying this solution to multiple subscriptions in the same tenant and want to use the Start VM On Connect feature, set the StartVmOnConnect parameter to false.  The custom role should be created at the Management Group scope.  The role assignment for the WVD service using the custom role should be set at the Management Group scope as well.  The Start VM On Connect feature would need to be manually enabled on the host pool per deployment.

## Post Deployment Requirements

- A management VM is deployed to facilitate the domain join of the Azure Storage Account, if using AD for domain services, and to set the NTFS permissions on the Azure File Share.  After the deployment succeeds, this VM and its associated resources may be removed.
